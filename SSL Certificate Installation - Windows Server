Bind SSL to SmarterMail in IIS:
  > Open IIS Manager.
  > Locate the SmarterMail website in the Sites list.
  > Select Bindings > Add > Choose https.
  > Assign the SSL certificate to the domain.

NOTE: If your SSL certificate is not showing in IIS during the binding process, it may indicate an issue with the certificate installation. 
      Here are some troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue:

# Verify SSL Certificate Installation

    Open the Certificates MMC:
      > Press Windows + R, type mmc, and press Enter.
      > Go to File > Add/Remove Snap-in.
      > Select Certificates > Add > Choose Computer Account > Next > Local Computer > Finish.

    Navigate to Certificates (Local Computer) > Personal > Certificates.
      > Check if your SSL certificate is listed here.
      > If not, the certificate may not have been installed properly.

# Install the SSL Certificate

If the certificate is missing, install it:
  > Open IIS Manager.
  > Click on the server name (at the top of the Connections panel).
  > Double-click Server Certificates in the middle pane.
  > Click Import in the Actions panel on the right.
      - Browse to your certificate file (usually .pfx format).
      - Enter the password for the certificate (if required).
      - Complete the import process.


NOTE: If you cannot see Server Certificates in the IIS Manager, it means the server-level settings are not currently displayed. 
To resolve this, follow these steps:

Step 1: Navigate to Server-Level Settings
       > In the Connections panel on the left, select the server name at the very top of the hierarchy (e.g., WIN-VG3F1ER4SPN in your screenshot).
          - This is the root node for the IIS server configuration.
       > In the middle pane, locate and double-click Server Certificates.

Step 2: Check for the Certificate
        > In the Server Certificates window:
          - Look for your SSL certificate in the list.
          - If it's not listed, proceed to import the certificate.
Step 3: Import the Certificate
        > In the Actions panel on the right, click Import.
        > Browse to the SSL certificate file (typically a .pfx file).
        > Enter the password for the certificate (if required).
        > Complete the import process.

Step 4: Bind the Certificate to SmarterMail
        > Return to the SmarterMail site in IIS.
        > Open Bindings in the Actions panel.
        > Click Add, select https, and choose the certificate from the dropdown.
